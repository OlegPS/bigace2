          &raquo; CrystalX Smarty Theme &laquo;


 You are about to install my port of the CrystalX theme!

 This template requires the SEO Extension to be installed (at least v0.5) from:
 <a target="_blank" href="http://wiki.bigace.de/bigace:extensions:seo">http://wiki.bigace.de/bigace:extensions:seo</a>
 It will not work properly without the SEO extension!
 CrystalX has support for the News and Comment Plugin that have to be installed and configured before use
 Currently the template generates an error if you do not have the comments plugin installed

 This Theme has an help-page, that needs to be de-activated before use!

 See the Help-page for more information.

 And please give feedback in the forum at:
